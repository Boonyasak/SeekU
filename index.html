				<h1>SeekU</h1>
				<p>Pronounced "See Queue," SeekU is a micro framework
				for making CQRS + Event Sourcing enjoyable.</p>

				<h3>What is CQRS?</h3>
				<div><blockquote>CQRS is simply the creation of two objects where there was previously only one. The separation occurs based upon whether the methods are a command or a query.</blockquote></div>
				<div style="martin-top: 20px;">
					<p>SeekU helps solve the complexities of building a distributed, event-driven system using CQRS and Event Sourcing.</p>
					<p>At it's most basic, SeekU is a series of in-memory providers that marshal events through your object model.</p>
				</div>
				
				<h3>SeekU Providers</h3>
				<p>Each layer of SeekU can be replaced with your own provider.  It's a trivial task to override the defaults in
				favor of using an Azure Service Bus for event publishing and MongoDB for Snapshot storage, for example.</p>
				
				<h3>Command Handling</h3>
				<p>The default command handler send commands into your domain object to change the state of your model.  By default
				this is in-memory, however it can easily be replaced with NServiceBus, Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ, or any other
				means of sending messages across application layers.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Event Handling</h3>
				<p>Like command handling, the default event handler broadcasts events to subscribers.  Similarly, events
				can be sent across boundaries via Azure Service Bus, NServiceBus, etc...</p>
				
				<h3>Event Stream Storage</h3>
				<p>SeekU is extremely flexible in terms of storing a history of domain events.  Currently there are
				providers for SQL Server, MongoDB, Azure Table Storage, and flat JSON files.  Creating your own storage
				provider is as simple as inheriting from a base class and implementing a pair of methods.</p>
				
				<h3>Snapshot Storage</h3>
				<p>SeekU uses snapshots to help keep the process of loading domain objects as fast as possible.  In
				situations where there are thousands of events in an object's history, loading each event can be time
				consuming.  Snapshots provide a point in time where the state of the domain is saved and only new
				events need be applied.</p>
				
				<p>Currently there are snapshot
				providers for SQL Server, MongoDB, Azure Blob Storage, and flat JSON files.  Creating your own snapshot
				provider is as simple as inheriting from a base class and implementing a pair of methods.</p>
