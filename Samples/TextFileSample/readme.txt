This sample shows how you can store the event stream and snapshots data on disk.

By default the event and snapshot files are stored in the bin\debug or bin\release directory.  Update
the app.config file to change the folder location and folder names.

In order to run this sample you need to:

1. Run it.  By default it'll just work.
2. Optionally Update the app.config with directory paths to override defaults.
