These samples show examples of a few different IoC containers.  There are likely more graceful
ways of using Ninject and Castle Windsor, but the point is to demostrate that you can use
the IoC tool of your choice with SeekU.

Samples include:

+ StructureMap - includes assembly scanning and open type closing.
+ Ninject - vanilla implementation, using the extensions contrib would make it cleaner.
+ Castle Windsor - this implementation is simplistic, but it proves the concept works.
